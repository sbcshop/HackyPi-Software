# HackyPi-Software
HackyPi is a compact and versatile USB device powered by the RP2040 microcontroller. It is a powerful tool for both ethical hacking and learning programming, compatible with all major operating systems. You can program using python language. Its sleek and modern design, combined with a user-friendly interface, makes it easy to use for beginners and experts alike. HackyPi is highly portable.

## Setup HackyPi
1. Download and Install Thonny IDE for your respective OS from Link [Download Thonny](https://thonny.org/)

2. Adding **CircuitPython** bootloader in HackyPi 

     For this first you need to *Press and Hold* the boot button on HackyPi, without releasing the button connect it to USB port of PC/laptop. 
Then you see a new device named "RPI-RP2" drag file ["firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/HackyPi-Software/blob/main/firmware.uf2) available in this repository to the device as shown in figure, or you can download from Circuitpython official website [click here](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)

     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/HackyPi-Software/blob/main/images/HackyPi_bootloader_install.gif" />
After downloading just copy and paste firmware file to "RPI-RP2" folder and then remove the device.
Now at this step bootloader installed properly inside Pico of Hackypi. To verify remove device and re-insert into PC/Laptop, no need to press boot button. 
This time you will see a new device as shown in the below image:-

**Running First Code in HackyPi**
1. Start Thonny IDE application, after this go to run->select interpreter, choose device and suitable com port

    <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/RoundyPi/blob/main/images/img19.png" />
    Write simple python code and click on green run button

2. Now you are ready to try out your own codes. Even you can try some of below Example codes provided, for that just copy all the files (library files) from [```lib```](https://github.com/sbcshop/HackyPi-Software/tree/main/lib) folder of this repository and paste inside the HackyPi ```lib``` folder

### Run Script Standalone without Thonny IDE
   Follow below steps to save your script to device, once done then remove device and reinsert in PC to run your script without the need of Thonny IDE. Meaning you can now plug to USB Port and your code will be executed by HackyPi.
   
   **And remember to save your script as _code.py_ name into device otherwise script will not run after inserting into USB.**
